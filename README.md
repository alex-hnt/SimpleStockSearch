# SimpleStockSearch
A tool to quickly bring you to websites that you use to get stock market information.

## How to Use
Run the program and enter a ticker symbol. You can change the websites and theme by clicking on the `$` to the left of the text area. Once the program disappears, it will run in the system tray until open or closed. Press `<shift>+<caps lock>+4` to bring up the search window again.
